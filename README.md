# PictureGrid

## Summary

PictureGrid lets you add a grid to a picture. This is aimed at artists, to save the effort of drawing the grid by hand.

There is other software that also can add a grid to a picture, such as GIMP. However, I hope to provide an interface as simple as possible for this task with PictureGrid.
